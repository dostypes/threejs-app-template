# Progress: Stable Template Foundation

**Current Status:** The project provides a stable, functional template demonstrating the `AppBrain` architecture for integrating Three.js, UI, and Services. The Memory Bank has been updated to reflect this state.

**What Works (Core Template Features):**

- **Modular Structure:** Clear separation of concerns with `AppBrain`, `UIManager`, `ServicesManager`, `ThreeManager`, and `AIHandler`.
- **Service -> UI/3D Flow:** Simulated external events (`AIHandler`) trigger updates in both the UI (`UIManager.changeInfoText`) and the 3D scene (`ThreeManager.changeColor`) via `AppBrain`.
- **UI -> 3D Flow:** User interaction with UI elements (`ToggleButton`) triggers actions in the 3D scene (`ThreeManager.toggleCubeVisibility`) via `UIManager` and `AppBrain`.
- **3D -> UI Flow:** User interaction with 3D objects (`Cube` selection via `InputHandler`) triggers updates in the UI (`UIManager.changeInfoText`) via `ThreeManager` and `AppBrain`.
- **Development Environment:** Vite dev server (`npm run dev`) runs correctly with HTTPS.

**What's Left to Build (Potential Next Steps for Users):**

- Replace simulated `AIHandler` with actual service integrations (e.g., WebSocket connection, API fetching).
- Expand UI features and components within `UIManager`.
- Add more complex 3D objects and interactions within `ThreeManager`.
- Implement more sophisticated state management if needed.
- Add unit or integration tests.

**Known Issues:**

- None currently known within the scope of the template's demonstrated features.

**Evolution of Decisions:**

- The architecture evolved from a less structured approach to the current `AppBrain` pattern to improve modularity and maintainability.
- `EventEmitter` was adopted across relevant modules (`AIHandler`, `ServicesManager`, `UIManager`, `ThreeManager`, `ToggleButton`) to facilitate decoupled communication towards `AppBrain`.

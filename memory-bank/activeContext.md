# Active Context: Memory Bank Update & Consolidation

**Current Focus:** Updating the Memory Bank to accurately reflect the stable `AppBrain` architecture and its purpose as a reusable template. Removing outdated information related to the previous refactoring task.

**Recent Changes (Summary):**

- The core `AppBrain` architecture was implemented, separating UI, Services, and Three.js logic.
- Event flows were established for:
  - Simulated service -> `AppBrain` -> UI/Three.js (`changeColor`)
  - UI interaction -> `AppBrain` -> Three.js (`toggleCube`)
  - Three.js interaction -> `AppBrain` -> UI (`objectSelected`)
- Memory Bank files were created during the refactoring process.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Complete Memory Bank Update:** Finish updating all memory bank files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) to reflect the current state and template focus.
2.  **Review:** Ensure all memory bank files are consistent and accurately represent the project.

**Active Decisions:**

- Consolidate memory bank documentation to focus on the template's structure and purpose, removing historical refactoring details.

**Patterns & Preferences:**

- **Architecture:** `AppBrain` pattern for centralized orchestration.
- **Communication:** `EventEmitter` for signaling _from_ modules (`AIHandler`, `UIManager`, `ThreeManager`) _to_ `AppBrain` (via `ServicesManager` where applicable). Direct method calls _from_ `AppBrain` _to_ modules (`UIManager`, `ThreeManager`).
- **Modularity:** Strict separation of concerns between UI, Services, and Three.js.

**Learnings:**

- The `AppBrain` architecture provides a clear and maintainable structure for integrating different application layers (UI, Services, 3D).
- Using `EventEmitter` effectively decouples components, allowing them to signal changes without direct dependencies.
